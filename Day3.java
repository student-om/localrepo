/* 
abstrct class object cannot be created but sub class objects can be created
normal methods are valid in abstract class
if a method is an abstract method, then ut must be given an abstract heading

an abstraxt method is a method without any body .it is written when the same method has to perform different tasks depending
on the object calling it

an abstract class is a class that contains 0 or more abstract methods

we cannot create abstract method object but we can create a referance. as ref is of super class type
it can refer to  all the objects of the subclass and use their methods
eg--> Myclass ref;
ref = sub1;
sub1.calculate(3);
ref = sub2;
sub1.calculate(4);
ref = sub3;
sub1.calculate(5);
